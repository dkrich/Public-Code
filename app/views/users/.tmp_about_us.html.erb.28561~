		The Founders
	</div>
	<div class="about_us_body">
		One evening, a mom and former financial advisor from Detroit, and the	other, a software engineer from Atlanta, began discussing the annoyances experienced by busy workers in office buildings
		with limited options for lunch.
		<p>They realized that on most days, they and their coworkers had to either rush to pack a lunch in the morning, or go out for an expensive, unhealthy lunch in the afternoon.</p>
		<p>They began discussing the idea of a delivery service that took care of busy individuals on the days when they need it. A few months later, Littlejaw was born.</p>

		Our Guiding Principles
	</div>
	<table class="principles_table" cellspacing=20>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">
				<div class="about_us_subtitle">
					If we wouldn't pay to eat it, you won't either.
				</div>
				<div class="about_us_body">
					We won't serve you anything that we wouldn't eat ourselves. Above all else, that's our guiding principle.
					That's why our carefully-selected daily menu contains
					only the freshest, highest-quality ingredients.
					<p>All meals are prepared in an MDA-certified commercial kitchen by trained, licensed chefs.</p>
					<p>At Littlejaw, safety and sanitation are our highest priorities. Every day we will deliver you a lunch that will make your co-workers
					jealous.</p>
					Trust us, this stuff is awesome.
				</div>
				<div class="about_us_subtitle">
					People like flexibility.
				</div>
				<div class="about_us_body">
					We all love to get out of the office during the day. Sometimes we want to go run errands, grab a cup of coffee, or just experience a new restaurant. We get that, and that's why
					our ordering system allows you to decide whether you want us to take care of your lunch, or whether you would rather handle it yourself.
				</div>
				<div class="about_us_subtitle">
					Our customers don't like being annoyed.
				</div>
				<div class="about_us_body">
					If there is one thing that we hate, it is annoying emails or daily fliers stuck in our doors or mailboxes. Chances are
					you aren't too keen on them either. That's why we promise we will never abuse your personal information by blasting you
					with ads or information you don't need, or distributing any of your information to third-parties.
					<br><br>
					We know that our customers have placed their trust in us, and we will never jeopardize that.
				</div>
				<div class="about_us_subtitle">
					Simplicity at every step.
				</div>
				<div class="about_us_body">
					One of the main reasons our customers use our service is so they don't have to spend any time thinking about what they're going to do for lunch
					(apart from the great food).
					<p>That's why we want to make this service as simple as possible to use. We want you to be able to "get in and get out" and not
					waste valuable time navigating a complex maze with a lot of fine print.
				</div>
			</td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">
				<div class="about_us_subtitle">
					No hidden fees, charges, or tips.
				</div>
				<div class="about_us_body">
					Nobody likes to be toyed with or treated like they're stupid. Yet every day that's exactly how most delivery services treat their customers.
					<p>After all, most restaurants that deliver will charge you a delivery fee, and might throw in a processing fee for good measure. (Seriously, does anybody know what
					the heck a "processing fee" is? If so, please let us know, because we don't, and we flat don't like 'em.)</p>
					<p>Then, after all that, when the driver shows up, you have to leave a tip. So that nice 6 dollar sandwich has just somehow grown into a 10 dollar sandwich, which is funny, because we're pretty sure
					you're getting the same sandwich that you thought you were when they told you it was 6 bucks.</p>
					With Littlejaw, there are no hidden fees, no delivery charges, and no tips. All costs are made clear and paid up front, so all you have to do
					is decide on which days you want us to bring you an awesome lunch.
				</div>
				<div class="about_us_subtitle">
					Dependability is a must.
				</div>
				<div class="about_us_body">
					Our customers rely on us for their lunch every day, and we take that responsibility very seriously. Our reputation
					is our livelihood, and that's why we promise to be on time and reliable. If a problem ever arises, we will make
					it right.

		Some Commonly Asked Questions
	</div>
	<div class="about_us_body">
		<div class="about_us_subtitle">
			You've got questions? Great, we've probably heard them before. Here are some of the things we're often asked.
		</div>
		<div class="about_us_faq">
			Other delivery services offer multiple menu choices. Why don't you?
		</div>
		<div class="about_us_faq_body">
			<p>Think of the restaurant you eat at most often.</p>
			<p>Now think about the last several items you ordered at that restaurant.</p>
			<p>Chances are that you can count on one hand the number of unique things you ate. If that sounds familiar, it's because
			when most people familiarize themselves with a menu at a favorite restaurant, they know what they like, and the
			rest is just a distraction.</p>
			<p>Our goal is for you to trust us to craft a delicious meal for you every day you want it. We feel confident that we
			can do that, because we put all our attention into a few items, as opposed to a little attention into several items,
			most of which you don't want anyway.</p>
			<p>Menus are rotated on a daily basis, so you're never eating the same thing two days in a row.</p>
			<p>Each day's menu is posted in advance, so you can easily view what we will be serving on a particular day. If you don't
			like it, simply opt out that day, and we will try to do better the next time. We don't expect this to happen often,
			but if it does, we would appreciate you letting us know, so we can make it better.</p>

		<div class="about_us_faq">
			Why can't I change my mind after 8am? What's so special about 8am?
		</div>
		<div class="about_us_faq_body">
			<p>In short, we do this to save you money.</p>
			<p>You might like having the ability to call up a delivery service on a moment's notice
			or the flexibility of being able to drive to the local deli for your lunch whenever you want, but you are paying a lot
			for that convenience.</p>
			<p>A typical restaurant has to be able to respond to unpredictable demand, spend an enormous amount of cash on the overhead associated with keeping a
			store open 12 or more hours a day, and keep a huge set of ingredients around to meet any request. Guess who ends up paying for all that?</p>
			<p>By offering a limited menu and gathering orders in advance, we strip all those costs out, and pass the savings onto you.</p>
